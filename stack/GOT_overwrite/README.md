# GOT-overwrites:
What is GOT overwriting? GOT overwriting is a common technique that's preformed by overwriting GOT entry addresses with other libc functions to intercept function calls. For example, we can overwrite the ``puts()`` GOT entry address with the ``system()`` call and it'll replace every ``puts()`` call with our desired libc function address.
