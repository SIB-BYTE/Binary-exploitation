# PIE / PIC:
What is PIE / PIC? Position independent executable / position independent code (PIE / PIC) is a mechanism that takes over the idea of how the dynamic linker / loader will load your program into memory. See your program is loaded into memory via ld.so, which is the object file for the linux dynamic linker and loader and the loaders job is to figured out where to load your binay into memory at. The purpose of PIE is to randomize the base address of the binary upon run-time thus we cannot hardcode things like symbol addresses or memory addresses inside of the binary. So what does that look like?
