# Stack canary: (Stack-cookies, SSP, et cetera, et cetera it's all the same damn thing)
What are stack canaries? What are they used for? Can they be defeated? If so then how?

Stack canaries are a form of user-space binary security mechanisms targeting mitigation towards stack memory corruption, the way it works is very interesting and it's a very hard mitigation to get past, but it can be done. The way they work is by constructing a specific value and pushing it onto the stack after your program, so this value is placed right before the return address of said stack frame. (If you don't know what a stack frame go check out my memory/stack/ directory) So with that being said and with knowledge of what a buffer overflow is and what it results in (control over the return address to hijack control-flow from RIP / EIP) thus for us to control the return address, we will have to hit the canary resulting in a SIGART like so:
