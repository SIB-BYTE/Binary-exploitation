# Ret2libc / Ret2sys
What is ret2libc? What is ROP?

Let's answer the latter first. What the fuck is ROP, and why in the name of fuck is it so hard to learn about? It's primarily very complex and tedious to learn about
because of the learning curve you pick it up on, usually you learn about ROP to bypass a hand-full user-space and kernel-space program memory protections and exploit mitigations, the main one we're focusing on today is NX, we're not going to worry about other ones right now. 

# NX (No eXecute) / DEP (For windows, data execution prevention)
Basically, for every page table entry there is this specific bit-flag that can be set or not, this bit-flag is known at the NX bit, if this is set it'll mark the memory regions as non-executable, therefore rending trivial buffer-overflow as useless because with the NX bit-flag set in our binaries our program call-stack won't be able to execute code on itself. Knowing how buffer-overflows work we just execute what we put in our buffer but we can't do that with NX.
