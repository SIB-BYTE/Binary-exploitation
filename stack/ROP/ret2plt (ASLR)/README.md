# Ret2plt:
Ret2plt is a popular exploitation technique derived of ROP and ret2libc but is primarily used on binaries that not only have NX-enabled, but also ASLR. We can check to see if ASLR is on or not with this simple command (You'll need to sudo it more than likely): ``cat /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space``. We can tell if ASLR is set or not if it's a 0 : ``off`` or a 2 : ``on``.

# ASLR (For linux):
What the fuck is ASLR? ASLR is address space layout randomization. Any takers on what this means in the context of an executable? Memory randomization! Now this completely fucks up our older techniques because we hardcoded addresses in our binaries memory, we cannot do this now due to the fact that ASLR is actually a virtual memory exploit mitigation that randomizes the addresses of our programs addressing space, but not our actual binaries addresses this is another exploit mitigation known as PIE / PIC, which I will be convering soon. So, if we cannot hardcode the addresses of which we use for our exploit script, how can we exploit a vulnerable binary in the first place? Ret2plt I say!!!
