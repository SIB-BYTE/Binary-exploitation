# Ret2plt:
Ret2plt is a popular exploitation technique derived of ROP / ret2libc but is primarily used on binaries that not only have NX-enabled, but also ASLR. We can check to see if ASLR is on or not with this simple command (You'll need to sudo it more than likely): ``cat /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space``. We can tell if ASLR is set or not if it's a 0 : ``off`` or a 2 : ``on``.

# ASLR (For linux):
What the fuck is ASLR? ASLR is address space layout randomization. Any takers on what this means in the context of an executable? Library function address randomization! Now this completely fucks up our older techniques because we hardcoded addresses in our binaries exploit, we cannot do this now due to the fact that ASLR randomizes the base addresses of shared object libraries (like libc) in our programs addressing space, but not our actual binaries addresses this is another exploit mitigation known as PIE / PIC, which I will be convering soon. So if we cannot hardcode the addresses of which we use for our exploit script, how can we exploit a vulnerable binary in the first place? Ret2plt I say!!! 

# GOT and PLT:
The ``GOT`` and the ``PLT`` are 2 major aspects of dynamic linking shared object libraries to our binary. These 2 aspects of indirection that's included from the problem of: ASLR messing with hardcoded addresses for functions in dynamically linked libraries and having to constantly recompile every single binary that uses said function every time a new libc update is pushed. So how does it work? Your program won't hold the actual code for a function like ``puts``, instead it'll call a ``puts@plt`` stub to either jump to a GOT entry, or resolve a function address that's not already been resolved using ``dl_runtime_resolve``. This process is known as lazy binding. 

# Lazy binding:
Lazy binding is the process of PLT checking to see if a function address has been resolved or not. Some C pseudo-code would look like this:
```c
_Bool printf_resolved = False;

if(printf_resolved == False)
{
   call dl_runtime_resolve_xsave();
}

else
{
   push printf_offset;
   call printf;
}
```
