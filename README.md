# Binary-exploitation
Binary exploitation.

# Guidance for beginners:
If you're COMPLETELY new to binary exploitation and memory in general, I'd stack out with /memory/stack and get a comfortable understanding of what the stack is, how it's layed out in memory and even more important, how to exploit it. This repository does **not** explain how to do trivial non-protected buffer overflow walkthroughs, this repository is primarily for me to learn because I learn best by teaching, but might as well make this public is for people to understand more advanced concepts. After learning more about memory structure, I'd slowly move into learning about ROP which I explain in /stack/ROP/ret2libc. As I said, this is primarily for me to learn. But I will make it worth your time and link some useful articles revolving around pwn:
