# The Heap:

Where is the heap? What is the heap? What does it look like? How do I use it?

The answer to the first question is that the heap is apart of your user-space addressing space memory, it's a segment of said space that's above the 3 sections that store program relative data such as initalized global data, uninitalized global data and your instructions (.data, .bss and .text):

It grows upwards towards larger addresses in your user-space addressing space.

So what is the heap? The heap is a segment of your addressing space that is summoned upon a call to dynamic memory allocator interface functions such as any of the alloc family functions such as ``malloc`` or ``calloc``will summon a run-time heap. The heap isn't a big blob of memory,
