# The Heap:
What is the heap? The heap is a dynamically allocated memory structure that is put in place upon run-time from libc with the usage of your memory allocators API interface functions namely: ``malloc``, ``calloc`` and ``realloc``. The heap is used in order to store data in a longer time-period than things on the stack do. Objects only last as long as the frame of the function lasts, after that your stack objects are deconstructed along with the stack frame itself. Not the case with the heap, it doesn't simply go away, we can make requests to the heap allocator for size-specified chunks that we can cache back to the heap allocator via using the ``free`` interface function.

Where is the heap located? It's located in a segment of your programs memory that's above the sections that store program relative data such as initalized global data, uninitalized global data and your instructions (.data, .bss and .text):

// Keep in mind your heap doesn't have to be in this exact location, hell none of this has to be in this exact location, your linker and loader decides what gets stored where and how it's loaded in memory in such a way. Your ABI determines the format of the executable once laid in memory as well.

It grows upwards towards larger addresses in your user-space addressing space.
