# The Heap:
What is the heap?

Where is the heap located? It's located in a segment of your programs memory that's above the sections that store program relative data such as initalized global data, uninitalized global data and your instructions (.data, .bss and .text):

// Keep in mind your heap doesn't have to be in this exact location, hell none of this has to be in this exact location, your linker and loader decides what gets stored where and how it's loaded in memory in such a way. Your ABI determines the format of the executable once laid in memory as well.

It grows upwards towards larger addresses in your user-space addressing space.
