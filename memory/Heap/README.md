# The Heap:

What is the heap? Where is the heap? What does it look like? How do I use it?

The answer to the first question is that the heap is a part of your program's memory. It's a segment of said space that's above the sections that store program relative data such as initalized global data, uninitalized global data and your instructions (.data, .bss and .text):

It grows upwards towards larger addresses in your user-space addressing space.
