# Stack Data Structure.

What in the world is a stack? A stack is a memory region of your user-space memory addressing space, it is implemented using the stack data structure. This is a basic linear data structure that follows the behavior of LIFO / FIFO (Last in first out && First in first out) this is a specification of stacks that basically just means the last element pushed on the stack should be the first one popped off of it. A could way of visualizing a stack, would be to vision a stack of plates and with said stack plates, you can only do 2 operations with said stack and other sub-operations. Those operations include: popping elements (plates) and pushing elements (plates )off and onto the stack.
