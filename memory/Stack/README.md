# Stack Data Structure / Abstract Data Type:
What in the world is a stack? This is a basic linear abstract data type that follows the behavior of LIFO / FIFO (Last in first out && First in first out) this is a specification of stacks that basically just means the last element pushed on the stack should be the first one popped off of it. A could way of visualizing a stack, would be to vision a stack of plates and with said stack plates, you can only do 2 operations with said stack and other sub-operations. Those operations include: popping elements (plates) and pushing elements (plates) off and onto the stack. Here's an example:
```c
push(10)
push(20)
push(30)

pop()
pop()

Graph:
/* Pushing values onto the stack. */

+------+
|      |
|  30  |
|      |
+------+
||||||||
+------+
|      |
|  20  |
|      |
+------+
||||||||
+------+
|      |
|  10  |
|      |
+------+

/* Popping the values off of the stack. */

+------+
|      |
|  10  |
|      |
+------+
```
The sub-operations are solely for extra uses like peeking the top element of the stack, checking if it's empty / checking if it's full, et cetera, et cetera. Now onto the applications of stacks in RAM. 

# Call-Stack: 
What is a call-stack? A call-stack is a memory region in a user-space addressing-space for execution threads of processes on our system. A call-stack or just called "The stack" is used to store things like: local variables, passed function parameters when needed, return addresses and function frames. For example: 
```c
int main(void)
{
    int a = 5;
}
``` 

"a" in this case placed on the stack by allocating 4-bytes (size of an int in C) worth of space and moving the immediate value "5" into that space. The space-manipulation is done with special registers called: ``rsp`` and ``rbp``, I'll be more clear on what they are in my explanation of RAM-layout but for the context of this explanation they're just pointers to the top (rsp) and the base / bottom (rbp) of the current call-stack frame. So, what are stack frames as well? Stack frames are just a frame of which you're pushing onto the stack these frames are adjusted and referenced using the stack pointer registers I mentioned above.
